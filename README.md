# Sine Calculation with Sequential Network

## Project Description
This project focuses on the **design, development, and simulation of a sequential network** capable of calculating the sine of an angle between **0° and 359°**.  

The implemented architecture uses:  
- A **look-up table (LUT)** storing sampled sine values.  
- A **linear interpolation algorithm** to improve accuracy between stored points.
